        <p>Justin Timberlake's The 20/20 Experience was already one of 2013's bestselling albums. "Take Back the Night," the soulful single that leads off the album's second chapter, continues the journey. Sharp execution and a captivating retro-future aesthetic make Timberlake's third solo release among the most dazzling pop endeavors of 2013. The 20/20 Experience—2 of 2 completes Timberlake's double-length album.</p>

        <p> "Disturbia" earned Rihanna an award for Best International Song at the 2009 NRJ Music Awards and a nomination for Best Dance Recording at the 2009 Grammy Awards."Disturbia" is an uptempo dance-pop and electropop song with a "sizzling" beat. Lyrically, the song is about the experiences of anguish, anxiety and confusion. The song received positive reviews from music critics, who generally praised its dark musical tone, lyrics and beat, and noted that it is reminiscent of Rihanna's previous single, "Don't Stop the Music" (2007).</p>

        <p>Views was met with generally lukewarm reviews from critics, many of whom felt it was overlong and explored the same aesthetic of Drake's previous records but in less successful fashion. The album nonetheless became a massive commercial success, remaining at number one on the US Billboard 200 for ten weeks. "One Dance" became Drake's first Billboard Hot 100 number-one single as a lead artist, spending nine weeks at number one.</p>

        <p>When it comes to people eagerly awaiting Ed Sheeran’s new songs in 2016, the artist may be giving his fans some mixed signals—or rather, it may be his record label that’s doing that. The English singer-songwriter has had a relatively quiet year thus far, and releasing a new album isn’t really at the top of his to-do list right now. But if his label has it their way, the upcoming album may be dropping sooner than not only fans think, but also Ed Sheeran himself.</p>
